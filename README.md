# Home Finder üè†

With Home Finder, you can find your next home. I used Realty API for this project and it shows us properties that are available for sale in the United States. When searching for your next home, you can sort by newness, price, and height.

## How to run this app on your local machine?

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OzerOzturk/nextjs-real-estate.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder

   cd nextjs-real-estate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

4. Run the project

   ```


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
